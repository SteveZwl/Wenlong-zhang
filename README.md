Co-author of “GMM/HMM optimization for universal signal detection for speech signal with various noisy background”, submitted to 28th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2020), August 24-28, 2020 Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Co-author of “Comparison of embedded machine learning models for ECG signal processing in mobile platform”, submitted to 17th International Conference on Signal Processing and Multimedia Applications (SIGMAP 2020), July 8-10 2020, Paris France. 

Co-inventor of “an embedded machine learning application in mobile device for fetal heart-beat ultra-sound signal ”, US Patent pending.


Selective Research Oriented Course Projects:


Major contributor of “Simulated integrated microblog website”, Extract the logical structure of weibo and facebook, by using VUE + Java web-side and Hadoop+Hbase at the serve-side of technology stack, practice the design idea of MVC, besides separate the front and back ends. This project won the Outstanding Senior Design for the year 2017.

Designer of “Face recognition check-in system”, as the final project of machine learning course, a class check-in system is implemented by R language, Java and SVM algorithm, after testing the project reduced the time required for students to sign in and low error rate which won the top place for all projects in that class. 

Major contributor of “Game interaction platform”, as the first prize of Shanxi Province Software Design Innovation Competition in 2016, the project implemented the online game conversion change and online chat under the LAN environment.
